The first Solana vault wallet with privacy features by Elusiv

Our current non-custodial wallets offer freedom for people to do basically anything including handling their raw passphrase, connecting to random DApps which makes users prone to hacks, data loss, loss of funds and most importantly - lack of privacy
Vuena wallet is a vault that fixes all these by:
1. Storing passphrase on the user's computer in an encrypted format so that if hackers access it they still can't decrypt it without asking the user for his passcode
2. As a vault, Vuena doesn't allow connection to external sites, it only allows users to offload and onloading their funds from and to recognized wallets, with this there is no hack or loss of funds via scam smart contract connection
3. Vuena also allows scan to pay, it allows you to
connect your personal external wallets you want to fund (send to) as well as receive by connecting external wallets
This avoids hacks whereby the wallet a user wants to send funds to is switched to a scammer own
4. With Elusiv, Vuena allows users to send and receive privately, users receive privately because there is a middleman publickey (generated from the second keypair in the user's mnemonics) this middleman publickey receives funds with which users can privately refill the vault (the original keypair)

# Usecases
Vuena is an entirely different type of wallet - it is a Vault so it works hand in hand with the current wallets - Phantom, solflare and others, it serves as a secure vault from which users send to their mobile flexible wallets
